extractor.py: Module to extract relevant information from DICOM files.
This module reads DICOM files and extracts essential metadata, 
including patient information, modality, and image details.
The extracted information is used for data processing and analysis.

Key Functions:
- extract_dicom_info: Extract relevant information from a DICOM file.
- extract_patient_id: Extract the patient ID from DICOM metadata.
- extract_modality: Extract the modality (e.g., CT, MR) from DICOM metadata.
- extract_image_laterality: Extract the image laterality from DICOM metadata.
- extract_view_position: Extract the image view position from DICOM metadata.
- extract_study_date: Extract the study date from DICOM metadata.
- extract_scanning_sequence: Extract the scanning sequence from DICOM metadata.
- extract_series_description: Extract the series description from DICOM metadata.
- extract_instance_number: Extract the instance number from DICOM metadata.

Expected Usage:
- Extract relevant information from a DICOM file using `extract_dicom_info`.
- Access specific attributes using individual extraction functions.
- Process the extracted information for analysis or visualization.

Customization & Flexibility:
- The extraction functions can be extended to include additional attributes.
- The extracted information can be formatted or transformed based on requirements.
- The module can be integrated into existing data processing pipelines.

Performance & Compatibility:
- The module is optimized for processing DICOM files efficiently.
- It uses the pydicom library for reading DICOM files.
- The module is compatible with Python 3.6+ and can be used in various environments and platforms.

Best Practices & Maintenance:
- The script follows best practices for error handling, logging, and code readability.
- It is well-documented and can be easily maintained or extended by other developers.
- The script is designed to be robust and reliable for long-term use in data curation workflows.

Notes:
- This module is part of a larger data curation pipeline for multimodal breast imaging data.
- It is optimized for processing DICOM files but can be adapted for other types of medical imaging data.
- The script is designed to be run from the command line or as part of an automated workflow.
