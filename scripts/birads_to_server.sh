# Usage: ./birads_to_server.sh
# Example: ./script/birads_to_server.sh
# Description: This script copies files from a local directory to a remote server using scp.
# It includes error handling, path validation, and optimizations for transferring large datasets.

# Exit the script if any command fails to ensure safe execution
set -e

# Define the home directory using the system's HOME environment variable
home="$HOME"

# Source directory on your macOS system (using realpath for robustness)
# 'realpath' ensures the path is absolute and valid
SOURCE_DIR="$(realpath "$home/Git/dataset-multimodal-breast/data/birads/")"

# Define the target directory path on the remote server
TARGET_PATH="/data/datasets/dataset-multimodal-breast/data/birads/"

# Define batch size for handling large datasets
BATCH_SIZE=100  # Number of files to process in each batch

# Function to log messages to the terminal for better visibility
