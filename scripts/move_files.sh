# Usage: ./move_files.sh
# Example: ./scripts/move_files.sh
# Description: This script moves files from the unexplored folder to the checking folder 
# inside the dataset-multimodal-breast repository. It handles large datasets by processing files in batches, 
# offers parallelism for speed, checks disk space, and logs errors in the curation/logs folder.

# Exit script on any command failure
set -e

# Define home directory using the system's HOME environment variable
home="$HOME"

# Resolve the absolute paths for source, destination, and log directories
