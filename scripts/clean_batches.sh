# Usage: ./clean_batches.sh
# Example: ./script/clean_batches.sh
# Description: This script clears files in specified directories by removing them in batches.
# It's optimized for directories containing a large number of files by batching removals to minimize
# memory usage and ensure efficient file handling, especially for systems under heavy load.

# Exit the script if any command fails to ensure safe execution
set -e

# Define the home directory using the system's HOME environment variable
home="$HOME"

# Define base directories relative to the home directory using absolute paths for consistency
dataset_multimodal_breast="$home/Git/dataset-multimodal-breast"
dicom_images_breast="$home/Git/dicom-images-breast"

# Define the directories to clear; these are paths where files will be deleted in batches
directories=(
  "$dataset_multimodal_breast/tests/dicom/"
  "$dataset_multimodal_breast/tests/test001/"
  "$dataset_multimodal_breast/tests/test002/"
