# Usage: ./split_log_files.sh
# Example: ./script/split_log_files.sh
# Description: This script splits large .log files into smaller parts based on a maximum 
# file size and renames the split parts with a sortable numeric sequence. It captures 
# operations and errors in a log file and ensures directories exist. Adjusted for handling 
# larger datasets efficiently on macOS and Unix-based systems.

# Exit script on any command failure
set -e

# Define home directory using the system's HOME environment variable
home="$HOME"

# Directory containing .log files to process (use realpath for absolute paths)
LOG_DIR="$(realpath "$home/Git/dicom-images-breast/data/logs/toprocess")"

# Directory to save the split files (ensure it exists)
OUTPUT_DIR="$(realpath "$home/Git/dicom-images-breast/data/logs/processed")"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"  # Create output directory if it doesn't exist

# Log file to capture script operations and errors
LOG_FILE="$(realpath "$home/Git/dicom-images-breast/data/logs/splits/split_log_files.log")"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOG_FILE")"  # Ensure the log directory exists

# Maximum file size for splitting (in bytes), e.g., "40m" for 40MB
MAX_SIZE="40m"

# Initialize or clear the log file at the start of each run
echo "Starting new splitting session: $(date)" > "$LOG_FILE"

# Function to handle errors gracefully
# Arguments:
#   $1: The error message to log
