# Usage: ./copy_to_server.sh
# Example: ./script/copy_to_server.sh
# Description: This script copies files from a local directory to a remote server using rsync.
# Supports password-based authentication (using sshpass) and SSH key-based authentication.
# Optimized for large datasets with batch processing and parallel transfers.

# Exit immediately if any command fails to ensure safe execution
set -e

# Define the home directory using the system's HOME environment variable
home="$HOME"

# Resolve the absolute path of the source directory using realpath for robustness
SOURCE_DIR="$(realpath "$home/Git/dataset-multimodal-breast/")"

# Define the target directory path on the remote server (adjust as needed)
TARGET_PATH="/data/datasets/dataset-multimodal-breast/"

# Define the maximum number of parallel rsync processes to handle large datasets efficiently
MAX_PARALLEL_PROCESSES=4  # Adjust this based on your system's resources (e.g., CPU and network capacity)

# Function to log messages to the terminal for better visibility and debugging
# Arguments:
#   $1: The message to log
