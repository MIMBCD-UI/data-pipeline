"""
test_encryption.py: Unit tests for the encryption and secret phrase reading functionality.
This script tests two main functionalities: 
1. Encrypting a patient ID using a secret phrase.
2. Reading a secret phrase from a file.

The test ensures that the encryption process is working as expected, 
and that the secret phrase is correctly read from a temporary file.

Unit testing is achieved using the unittest framework.
